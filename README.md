Beta decay analysis using Lombscargle periodogram  for PTB and BNL datasets 

Recently Pomme et al. did an analysis of Cl(36) radioactive decay data from 
measurements at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt  (PTB), in order to verify the claims by  Sturrock and collaborators of an influence on beta-decay rates measured at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) due to the rotation-induced modulation of the  solar neutrino flux.  Their analysis excluded any sinusoidal modulations in the frequency range from 0.2-20/year.
We carry out an independent analysis of the same PTB and BNL data,   using the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram to look for any statistically significant peaks in the range from 0 to 14  per year, and by evaluating the significance of every peak using multiple methods. Our results for the PTB data  are in agreement with those by Pomme et al.  For BNL data, we do find peaks at  some of the same frequencies as Sturrock et al., but the significance is much lower.
